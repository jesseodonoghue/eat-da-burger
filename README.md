# Eat Da Burger!
This app required me to create an app that allows the user to create, eat, and delete burgers. This app uses express as the server, handlebars as the rendering engine, mySQL for the database, and uses an Object Relational Mapping model.

## App Breakdown
The user is presented with a text field to input a new burger. Once the new burger has been created, it is displayed in the "Uneaten" column. The user can eat a burger by clicking on the button next to each burger. Once the burger has been eaten, it moves over to the "Eaten" column where it can then be deleted:
